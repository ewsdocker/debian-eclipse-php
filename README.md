____
New Version: **1.1.5** (**edge**). _2018-05-05_.  
Stable Version: **1.1.0**

**docker pull** will pull the **latest** image by default.  The Docker **latest** tag is based on the GitHub **master** source, which is the development version, and quite possibly **unstable**.  

NOTE: If the _New Version_ version number is not in the **Tags**, the **latest** tag is still under test.  Testing will be complete when the _New Version_ tag exists.

Other Docker versions (or tags) can be selected on the Docker [Tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/ewsdocker/debian-eclipse-php/tags/) page.  

An explanation of the [Docker Tags](https://github.com/ewsdocker/debian-eclipse-php/wiki/DockerTags) is available on the [ewsdocker/debian-eclipse-php Wiki](https://github.com/ewsdocker/debian-eclipse-php/wiki).
