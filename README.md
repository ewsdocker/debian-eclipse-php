**docker pull** will pull the **latest** image by default.  

The Docker **edge** tag is based on the GitHub **master** source, which is the development version, and should be assumed to be **unstable**.  

Other Docker versions (or tags) can be selected on the Docker [Tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/ewsdocker/debian-eclipse-php/tags/) page. 

GitHub source branches and tags, if there are any, can be selected in the **Branch / Tag** selection box.  

NOTE: If the _New Version_ version number is not in the **Tags**, the **latest** tag is still under test.  Testing will be complete when the _New Version_ tag exists.

An explanation of the [Docker Tags](https://github.com/ewsdocker/debian-eclipse-php/wiki/DockerTags) is available on the [ewsdocker/debian-eclipse-php Wiki](https://github.com/ewsdocker/debian-eclipse-php/wiki).
